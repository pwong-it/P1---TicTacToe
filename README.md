# Tic Tac Toe :x::o::x:
The first project of my Software Engineering Immersive Course.<br/> 
Date Received: 22/11/22<br/>
Date Due: 25/11/22

## :computer: [Click here](#) to see my live project!

## :page_facing_up: About
The below are the criteria set out by the course that I will need to meet:
### Technical Requirements
The app that I am building must:
- Render a game in the browser
- Switch turns between more than one player
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### Necessary Deliverables
- At least one artefact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe demonstrating planning 
- A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
- A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Bonus extensions - Optional
- Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
- Allow game customizable options, time limits, board size, game rounds, name & profiles etc
- Allow players to customize their token (X, O, name, picture, avatar etc)
- Get inventive with your styling - research CSS effects, animations to spiff things up
- Research LocalStorage or SessionStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
- Use timers to display "waiting..." messages while users are waiting to be matched
- Research web audio API and add sound effects to your game
- Be creative! Bend the rules and give it a twist!

***I will be thinking of my own extras once I am at that stage. 

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Talk about approach to the problem.
- Add screenshots/drawings of doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- Programming languages
- Libraries
- Animations
- Anything else you'd be proud to show your parents

## :scream: Bugs to fix :bug:
- Anything a little broken
- Anything a LOT broken
- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)

## :sunglasses: Lessons learnt
What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this
